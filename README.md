# SPAMALOT

Better role assignments in Avalon. [Currently running here.](http://dylandmitri.pythonanywhere.com/)

## current features

#### create room 
 - specify roles, number of players
 - generates a room code (eg ```abcd```)
 
#### join room
 - requires the room code
 - when everyone has joined, assigns roles and tells you everything you need to know

## future features

#### Percival should see `Merlin` or `Morganna` rather than `Magicians` if there's only one of them. 

#### Fixing weird css bits.

#### bigger buttons for selecting roles

#### rooms have a "time since last interaction"
- rooms delete themselves after 2 hours
- the couple newest rooms are availible to quickjoin

#### option for drafting roles, rather than just random assignment

#### improve role listing
- ie "2 generic good" rather than "generic good, generic good"
